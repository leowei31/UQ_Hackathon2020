Topic:Employability

Because of COVID-19, a lot of people have lost their jobs and now have to rely on government emergency benefits to support themselves, and some people are left with no income at all if they donâ€™t meet the criterias to receive government benefits. Many businesses are left with a fraction of employees because of the fear of the virus. We want to address this problem with an application designed for businesses finding short term employees. We intend on saving costs in money and time for the businesses that are being impacted, as well as provide people without a stable income an opportunity to earn money on the side. Right now, we are seeing a huge growth in the gig economy where people are preferring the flexibility that it offers, and we believe our product could pave the way with easy integration for the future of work.   
  
The target audience for our product is : businesses/companies that have been impacted by the lack of sufficient workforce as well as people looking for a short term job to earn some extra cash. Businesses and companies will be able to post temporary job openings on our site with the tasks and location of the job, and people looking for work will be able to see the job posting through a google maps integration of the job postings to see whatever jobs is closest to them. If applicants have a prefilled resume, they will be able to apply for the job through the click of a button.
